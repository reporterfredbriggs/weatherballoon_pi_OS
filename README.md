# weatherballoon_pi_OS


This directory contains the custom OS to be flashed on the RaspBerry Pi. It should only be edited by SSHing and working directly in the pi. To update this directory, remove the flash drive from the Pi, drag the entire contents of the boot drive (the flash drive plugged into the USB to microSD conntector) into custom_pi_OS folder.

To put it back on the Pi, drag the custom_pi_OS onto the SD card to replace the current OS image.
